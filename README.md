Ackchyually not an engineer☝️🤓 (yet)

I’m Emil, a passionate computer science student based in Norrköping, Sweden, driven by curiosity and hands-on experimentation across machine learning, game development, and full‑stack applications. I love transforming ideas into prototypes, exploring new technologies, and collaborating on creative projects. Here you’ll find a selection of my favorite repositories showcasing a mix of academic labs, personal experiments, and open‑source contributions.
